4.	Unobtrusive Javascript is a way to write the javascript code. According to the principles of unobtrusive javascript, JavaScript code should be separate from HTML.
	Below are the key features behind writing the javascript code in an unobtrusive way:
	1. It's separate the code in 3 major categories HTML (UI/Content) , CSS (styling/Presentation) , JavaScript (logic/Behavior).
	2. Fast loading, as some of the old browsers don't support JS then at least HTML and CSS will load.
	3. Robustness, It's easy to maintain. Multiple developers can update, debug the respective pages separately.
