            Below the main heading is the page's overall content area, with an overall 33% rating for the film, several critics'
            reviews, and an overview of the film at right. Taken together this content occupies 800px in width and is centered
            horizontally within the page. If the page resizes horizontally, this 800px section should move dynamically so that it
            remains centered horizontally on the page.

            Format your HTML and CSS to be as readable as possible, similarly to the examples from class. Place a comment
            header in each file with your name, section, a brief description of the assignment, and the file's contents. Properly
            use whitespace and indent your HTML and CSS code as shown in class. To keep line lengths manageable, do not
            place more than one block element on the same line or begin a block element past the 100th character on a line. For
            reference, our solution has roughly 130 lines of CSS (85 "substantive"), but you do not need to match this exactly.
            Part of your grade will also come from successfully uploading your files to the web. You should place your files into
            your public web space in a subdirectory named hw2, so that it is possible to navigate to your page in the browser
