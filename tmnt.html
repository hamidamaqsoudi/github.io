            Below the main heading is the page's overall content area, with an overall 33% rating for the film, several critics'
            reviews, and an overview of the film at right. Taken together this content occupies 800px in width and is centered
            horizontally within the page. If the page resizes horizontally, this 800px section should move dynamically so that it
            remains centered horizontally on the page.
